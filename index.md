## HTTP-RPC Specification

### Introduction

This is the specification for HTTP-RPC, an architectural style for modeling web services in a flexible, scalable, portable, simple and realiable way. HTTP-RPC is easy for humans to understand and develop and easy for machines to parse and interact with. Its aim is to capture and formalize approaches to web services commonly encountered in the wild and that web services organically tend to evolve towards over time, but in a structured and maintainable way.

At its core, HTTP-RPC defines how endpoints should be structured and how to interact with them and with each other, how errors should be handled, how data exchange happens and how this get documented.
